    <p>Lambda invokes your function in a secure and isolated <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html">execution environment</a>. To handle a
      request, Lambda must first initialize an execution environment (the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html#runtimes-lifecycle-ib">Init phase</a>),
      before using it to invoke your function (the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html#runtimes-lifecycle-invoke">Invoke phase</a>):</p>

    <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>Actual Init and Invoke durations can vary depending on many factors, such as the runtime you choose
      and the Lambda function code. The previous diagram isn't meant to represent the exact proportions of Init and
      Invoke phase durations.</p></div></div>
    <p>The previous diagram uses a rectangle to represent a single execution environment. When your function
      receives its very first request (represented by the yellow circle with label <code class="code">1</code>), Lambda creates
      a new execution environment and runs the code outside your main handler during the Init phase. Then, Lambda
      runs your function's main handler code during the Invoke phase. During this entire process, this execution
      environment is busy and cannot process other requests.</p>
    <p>When Lambda finishes processing the first request, this execution environment can then process additional
      requests for the same function. For subsequent requests, Lambda doesn't need to re-initialize the environment.</p>
    <div class="mediaobject">
       
        <img src="/images/lambda/latest/dg/images/concurrency-2-two-requests.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;        An execution environment handling two requests in succession.&#xA;      " style="max-width:100%" />
       
       
    </div>
    <p>In the previous diagram, Lambda reuses the execution environment to handle the second request
      (represented by the yellow circle with label <code class="code">2</code>).</p>
    <p>So far, we've focused on just a single instance of your execution environment (i.e. a concurrency of 1).
      In practice, Lambda may need to provision multiple execution environment instances in parallel to handle all
      incoming requests. When your function receives a new request, one of two things can happen:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>If a pre-initialized execution environment instance is available, Lambda uses it to process the request.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Otherwise, Lambda creates a new execution environment instance to process the request.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>For example, let's explore what happens when your function receives 10 requests:</p>
    <div class="mediaobject">
       
        <img src="/images/lambda/latest/dg/images/concurrency-3-ten-requests.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;        A Lambda function handling 10 requests. It must provision multiple environments to handle all requests.&#xA;      " style="max-width:100%" />
       
       
    </div>
    <p>In the previous diagram, each horizontal plane represents a single execution environment instance
      (labeled from <code class="code">A</code> through <code class="code">F</code>. Here's how Lambda handles each request:</p>

    <p>As your function receives more concurrent requests, Lambda scales up the number of execution
      environment instances in response. The following animation tracks the number of concurrent
      requests over time:</p>
    <div class="mediaobject">
       
        <img src="/images/lambda/latest/dg/images/concurrency-4-animation.gif" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;        An animation illustrating concurrent requests over time.&#xA;      " style="max-width:100%" />
       
       
    </div>
    <p>By freezing the previous animation at six distinct points in time, we get the following
      diagram:</p>
    <div class="mediaobject">
       
        <img src="/images/lambda/latest/dg/images/concurrency-5-animation-summary.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;        Function concurrency at six distinct points in time.&#xA;      " style="max-width:100%" />
       
       
    </div>
    <p>In the previous diagram, we can draw a vertical line at any point in time and count the
      number of environments that intersect this line. This gives us the number of concurrent requests
      at that point in time. For example, at time <code class="code">t1</code>, there are 3 active environments serving
      3 concurrent requests. The maximum number of concurrent requests in this simulation occurs at
      time <code class="code">t4</code>, when there are 6 active environments serving 6 concurrent requests.</p>
    <p>To summarize, your function's concurrency is the number of concurrent requests that it's handling
      at the same time. In response to an increase in your function's concurrency, Lambda provisions more
      execution environment instances to meet request demand.</p>
   
    <h2 id="calculating-concurrency">How to calculate concurrency</h2>
    <p>In general, concurrency of a system is the ability to process more than one task simultaneously.
      In Lambda, concurrency is the number of in-flight requests that your function is handling at the same
      time. A quick and practical way of measuring concurrency of a Lambda function is to use the following

    <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="">Concurrency = (average requests per second) * (average request duration in seconds)</code></pre>
    <p><b>Concurrency differs from requests per second.</b> For example,
      suppose your function receives 100 requests per second on average. If the average request duration
      is 1 second, then it's true that the concurrency is also 100:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="">Concurrency = (100 requests/second) * (1 second/request) = 100</code></pre>
    <p>However, if the average request duration is 500 ms, the concurrency is 50:</p>

    <p>What does a concurrency of 50 mean in practice? If the average request duration is 500 ms, you
      can think of an instance of your function as being able to handle 2 requests per second. Then, it
      takes 50 instances of your function to handle a load of 100 requests per second. A concurrency of
      50 means that Lambda must provision 50 execution environment instances to efficiently handle this
      workload without any throttling. Here's how to express this in equation form:</p>

    <p>If your function receives double the number of requests (200 requests per second), but only

    <h2 id="concurrency-vs-requests-per-second">Concurrency vs. requests per second</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in the previous section, concurrency differs from requests per second. This is an
      especially important distinction to make when working with functions that have an average request
      duration of less than 100 ms.</p>
    <p>In general, each instance of your execution environment can handle at most 10 requests per
      second. This limit applies to synchronous on-demand functions, as well as functions that use
      provisioned concurrency. In you're unfamiliar with this limit, you may be confused as to why
      such functions could experience throttling in certain scenarios.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a function with an average request duration of 50 ms. At 200 requests
      per second, here's the concurrency of this function:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="">Concurrency = (200 requests/second) * (0.05 second/request) = 10</code></pre>
    <p>Based on this result, you might expect that you only need 10 execution environment
      instances to handle this load. However, each execution environment can handle only 10
      executions per second. This means that with 10 execution environments, you can only handle
      100 requests per second out of the 200 total requests. This function experiences throttling.</p>
    <p>The lesson is that you need to consider both concurrency and requests per second when
      configuring concurrency settings for your functions. In this case, you need 20 execution
      environments for your function, even though it only has a concurrency of 10.</p>

    <h2 id="reserved-and-provisioned">Reserved concurrency and provisioned concurrency</h2>
    <p>By default, your account has a concurrency limit of 1,000 across all functions in a region. Your
      functions share this pool of 1,000 concurrency on an on-demand basis. Your function experiences
      throttling (i.e. it starts to drop requests) if you run out of available concurrency.</p>
    <p>Some of your functions might be more critical than others. As a result, you might want to configure
      concurrency settings to ensure that critical functions get the concurrency they need. There are two types
      of concurrency controls available: reserved concurrency and provisioned concurrency.</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Use <b>reserved concurrency</b> to reserve a portion of your account's

      </li><li class="listitem">

      <h3 id="reserved-concurrency-concept">Reserved concurrency</h3>
      <p>If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of concurrency is available for your function at any
        time, use reserved concurrency.</p>
      <p>Reserved concurrency is the maximum number of concurrent instances you want to allocate to your
        function. When you dedicate reserved concurrency to a function, no other function can use that
        concurrency. In other words, setting reserved concurrency can impact the concurrency pool that's
        available to other functions. Functions that don't have reserved concurrency share the remaining pool
        of unreserved concurrency.</p>
      <p>Configuring reserved concurrency counts towards your overall account concurrency limit. There is
        no charge for configuring reserved concurrency for a function.</p>
      <p>To better understand reserved concurrency, consider the following diagram:</p>
      <div class="mediaobject">
         
          <img src="/images/lambda/latest/dg/images/concurrency-6-reserved-concurrency.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;          Function scaling behavior when the user configures reserved concurrency on critical functions.&#xA;        " style="max-width:100%" />
         
         
      </div>
      <p>In this diagram, your account concurrency limit for all the functions in this region is at the default
        limit of 1,000. Suppose you have two critical functions, <code class="code">function-blue</code> and
        <code class="code">function-orange</code>, that routinely expect to get high invocation volumes. You decide to give 400
        units of reserved concurrency to <code class="code">function-blue</code>, and 400 units of reserved concurrency to
        <code class="code">function-orange</code>. In this example, all other functions in your account must share the remaining
        200 units of unreserved concurrency.</p>
      <p>The diagram has 5 points of interest:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">

        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>At <code class="code">t2</code>, <code class="code">function-orange</code> and <code class="code">function-blue</code> are steadily receiving

            You do not allocate reserved concurrency to these other functions. They begin using the remaining 200 units
            of unreserved concurrency.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>At <code class="code">t3</code>, <code class="code">function-orange</code> hits the max concurrency of 400. Although there is

            indicates that <code class="code">function-orange</code> is experiencing throttling, and Lambda may drop requests.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>At <code class="code">t4</code>, <code class="code">function-orange</code> starts to receive fewer requests and is no longer

            there is unused concurrency elsewhere in your account, these other functions cannot access it. The red

      <p>From this example, notice that reserving concurrency has the following effects:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>Your function can scale independently of other functions in your account.</b>
            All of your account's functions in the same region that don't have reserved concurrency share the pool of
            unreserved concurrency. Without reserved concurrency, other functions can potentially use up all of your
            available concurrency. This prevents critical functions from scaling up if needed.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>Your function can't scale out of control.</b> Reserved concurrency puts a cap
            on your function's maximum concurrency. This means that your function can't use concurrency reserved for other
            functions, or concurrency from the unreserved pool. You can reserve concurrency to prevent your function from
            using all the available concurrency in your account, or from overloading downstream resources.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>You may not be able to use all of your account's available concurrency.</b>
            Reserving concurrency counts towards your account concurrency limit, but this also means that other functions
            cannot use that chunk of reserved concurrency. If your function doesn't use up all of the concurrency that you
            reserve for it, you're effectively wasting that concurrency. This isn't an issue unless other functions in
            your account could benefit from the wasted concurrency.</p>

      <h3 id="provisioned-concurrency-concept">Provisioned concurrency</h3>
      <p>You use reserved concurrency to define the maximum number of execution environments reserved for a Lambda function.
        However, none of these environments come pre-initialized. As a result, your function invocations may take longer
        because Lambda must first initialize the new environment before being able to use it to invoke your function.
        When Lambda has to initialize a new environment in order to carry out an invocation, this is known as a cold start. 
        To mitigate cold starts, you can use provisioned concurrency.</p>
      <p>Provisioned concurrency is the number of pre-initialized execution environments you want to allocate to your
        function. If you set provisioned concurrency on a function, Lambda initializes that number of execution environments
        so that they are prepared to respond immediately to function requests.</p>
      <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>Using provisioned concurrency incurs additional charges to your account. If you're working with the
          Java 11 or Java 17 runtimes, you can also use Lambda SnapStart to mitigate cold start issues at no
          additional cost. SnapStart uses cached snapshots of your execution environment to significantly
          improve start-up performance. You cannot use both SnapStart and provisioned concurrency on the same
          function version. For more information about SnapStart features, limitations, and supported regions,
          see <a href="./snapstart.html">Improving startup performance with Lambda SnapStart</a>.</p></div></div>
      <p>When using provisioned concurrency, Lambda still recycles execution environments in the background. However, at
        any given time, Lambda always ensures that the number of pre-initialized environments is equal to the value of your
        function's provisioned concurrency setting. This behavior differs from reserved concurrency, where Lambda may
        completely terminate an environment after a period of inactivity. The following diagram illustrates this by
        comparing the lifecycle of a single execution environment when you configure your function using reserved
        concurrency compared to provisioned concurrency.</p>

        In other words, allocating reserved and provisioned concurrency can impact the concurrency pool that's
        available to other functions. Configuring provisioned concurrency incurs charges to your AWS account.</p>

        prevents it from executing. You can't allocate more provisioned concurrency than reserved concurrency

      <h3 id="allocating-provisioned-concurrency">How Lambda allocates provisioned concurrency</h3>
      <p>Provisioned concurrency doesn't come online immediately after you configure it. Lambda starts
        allocating provisioned concurrency after a minute or two of preparation. In particular, Lambda
        can provision between 500 to 3,000 execution environments at once, depending on the region.
        After this initial burst, Lambda allocates 500 additional environments per minute, regardless
        of the region, until the request is fulfilled.</p>
      <p>For example, suppose your account concurrency limit is 10,000. Also, suppose that at 10:00
        in US East (N. Virginia), you configure 5,000 units of provisioned concurrency for one function.
        Here's how Lambda might allocate provisioned concurrency units:</p>
      <div class="mediaobject">
         
          <img src="/images/lambda/latest/dg/images/provisioned-concurrency-allocation.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;          A line graph showing how Lambda allocates provisioned concurrency instances.&#xA;        " style="max-width:100%" />
         
         
      </div>
      <p>In the previous diagram:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Initially, Lambda can provision at max 3,000 execution environments, since the
            initial burst concurrency limit in US East (N. Virginia) is 3,000.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>At 10:00</b>: You request 5,000 units of provisioned
            concurrency for this function. Lambda doesn't begin provisioning execution environments
            instantaneously.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>At 10:01</b>: Lambda starts by provisioning 3,000
            environments.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>From 10:02 to 10:05</b>: Lambda provisions 500
            additional environments each minute. By 10:05, Lambda finishes allocating 5,000
            environments to your function.</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>When you submit a request to allocate provisioned concurrency, you can't access
        any of those environments until Lambda completely finishes allocating them. For example,
        in the previous scenario, none of your requests can use provisioned concurrency until
        10:05, since that's when Lambda completely finishes allocating your request of 5,000
        execution environments.</p>

    <h2 id="concurrency-quotas">Concurrency quotas</h2>
    <p>Lambda sets quotas for the total amount of concurrency you can use across all functions in a region. These quotas
      exist on two levels:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>At the account level</b>, your functions can have up to 1,000 units of concurrency
          by default. To increase this limit, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html">Requesting a quota increase</a> in the
          <em>Service Quotas User Guide</em>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>At the function level</b>, you can reserve up to 900 units of concurrency across
          all your functions by default. 100 units of concurrency are always reserved for functions that don't explicitly
          reserve concurrency. For example, if you increased your account concurrency limit to 2,000, you can reserve up
          to 1,900 units of concurrency at the function level.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>To check your current account level concurrency quota, use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to run the following command:</p>

      <code class="code">UnreservedConcurrentExecutions</code> is the amount of reserved concurrency you can still allocate to your

    <p>For initial bursts of traffic, your cumulative concurrency can reach a level of between 500 and 3,000
      depending on the region:</p>

    <p>After the initial burst increase, Lambda continues to scale up your function based
      on the following rules:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>If your function needs additional scaling, Lambda can scale up by a maximum of
          500 additional execution environment instances (burst quota units) per minute,
          regardless of the Region.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Each minute, you continue to accrue 500 burst quota units. If your function
          doesn’t require this level of scaling, Lambda saves up any unused units in an
          imaginary “bucket”, up until the bucket reaches the maximum burst concurrency
          limit in your Region. For instance, your bucket can continue to accrue 500 units
          per minute until it reaches 3,000 units in US East (N. Virginia). When your
          function encounters future bursts, Lambda draws from your bucket to scale up
          your function.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="./burst-concurrency.html">Burst concurrency</a>. If you need a burst concurrency limit increase,
      please inquire further through AWS Support. Service Quotas do not support changes in burst limits at this time.</p>
